## About The Project

The Project, <strong>Feel Well Web App</strong> is a Web Development project. It is a mental Health Care portal where we aim to spread awareness and Help user find ways to improve their mental health. It is designed with a minimalist interface for better user experience without any hurdle. 

The project consist of 3 main pages as <strong>Home page</strong>, <strong>Blog page</strong> and <strong>HappySpace page</strong>. Home page is the main page of the portal where we have described about the portal, contact details, review shared and other navigation options to move anywhere inside the portal. 
<br>Blog page is designed for the purpose of sharing words about the current Mental Health Scenerio, some tips and tricks and awareness about health via interactive blogs, so that user can learn happily and start thinking about mental health as a important part of their life.
<br>Here comes HappySpace page, this page is designed with the thought of how can we improve user's mood and help them give themselves a change of mind and be relaxed. Four branches have been added to it as <strong>Quiz</strong>, <strong>Music streams</strong>, <strong>Video Stream</strong> and <strong>Self monitoring page</strong>. Here, Users can interacte with the content they like or whatever their mood is to do. Self monitoring page, particularly, designed to let user use the portal to uderstand their current mood and be aware. Awareness about your own mood is necessary process to resolve issues which occur sometimes not by other external factors but internal. And for that, we need to be aware of Mental Illness, so that we can improve them and lead a happy and healthy life!
